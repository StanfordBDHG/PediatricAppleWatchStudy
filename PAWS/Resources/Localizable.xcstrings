Other than the fact that you are using an Apple Watch, there is no difference between being a part of the study and everything else about seeing your doctor.\n\nAny time that you feel symptoms that feel like an arrhythmia (i.e., palpitations, skipped beats, fast heart rate):\n\n1. First, press the event button on your Zio® Patch Monitor.\n2. Second, initiate a recording on the Apple Watch by following these steps:\n    • Open the ECG App.\n    • Hold your finger to the Digital Crown for 30 seconds.\n    • Follow the on-screen prompts on the Apple Watch."
